# DSA Programming Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various DSA problems implemented in Python, including LeetCode, Codeforces, and interview questions. Will be updating my solutions of more problems subsequently.

## Problems Solved

### LeetCode Problems
- **#179** - Largest Number
- **#261** - Graph Valid Tree
- **#325** - Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k
- **#505** - The Maze II
- **#755** - Pour Water
- **#792** - Number of Matching Subsequences
- **#904** - Fruit Into Baskets
- **#962** - Maximum Width Ramp
- **#1101** - The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends
- **#2215** - Find the Difference of Two Arrays

### Codeforces Problems
- **2185D** - Out of Memory Error (Contest 2185, Problem D)
- **800 Q1** - Array Sorting Check (Codeforces 800 level)

### Interview/Custom Problems
- **Find Edges to Remove for K Components** - Given an undirected graph, find the minimum number of edges to remove to disconnect into exactly k connected components. Uses DFS, tree/cycle special cases; general case reduces to minimum k-cut (NP-hard for k ≥ 3).
- **Rotation Table** - Given on-call rotation schedules (name, start, end), return a non-overlapping interval table of who is on call during each period. Uses sweep line with bisect; O(n log n + n·k) time.
- **Print Hierarchy** - [Google Phone Interview Question](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/569802/google-phone-print-hierarchy-by-anonymou-jsxz/)
- **Max Size of Islands in Tree** - Tree traversal problem to find maximum connected component size
- **Count Islands in Binary Tree** - Count connected components (islands) of same-valued nodes in a binary tree

Each solution file is named with the problem number and title for easy identification. Codeforces problems are organized in the `cp31/` directory, while LeetCode problems are in the root directory.
